# Notes on  **"Understanding Real-World Concurrency Bugs in Go"**

### This is my small gift to gophers who is/will read this paper to learn concurrency through pitfalls this will help you learn by actually running buggy code and then fixing it and learning actually :)

This repository contains my hands-on learnings, notes, and runnable code while studying and implementing concepts from the research paper **"Understanding Real-World Concurrency Bugs in Go"**. The goal of this repo is not theory repetition, but practical exploration: reproducing real concurrency bugs described in the paper, understanding why they happen, and verifying correct fixes by running the code.

This repo acts as my personal notebook while reading the paper documenting what breaks, why it breaks, and what actually works in practice. There are some of new learnings
which i got with other blogs are also added here and i have also added summary of the paper that what all i learned

You can try out this code snippets which are ready to use and test and not only read paper to play with it as a lab and not just do a passive learning.
